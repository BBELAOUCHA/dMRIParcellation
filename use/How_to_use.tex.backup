\section{How to use:}
There is two ways to use this code. Either on a Cluster or import it as a module in your personal python code.
\subsection{In a terminal (or Cluster)}
python run\_parcellation -i input\_path -o output\_path -seed coordinate -t tracto\_path -tb tracto\_prefix -NR Regions

\noindent \textbf{input\_path}: It is a matlab file that contain the followings:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Faces: The faces of the mesh (cortical surface) ($N\times 3$).
 \item Vertices: The coordinates of the vertices of the mesh (in anatomical or diffusion space) ($n\times 3$).
 \item Normal: The normal vector at each vertex ($n\times 3$).
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{output\_path}: path to the folder where you want to save the data. Be sure you have the right to write in this path.

\noindent \textbf{coordinate}: path to the file containing the coordinates ($n\times 3$ of int elements) of the mesh in the diffusion space. 

\noindent \textbf{tracto\_path}: path to the tractograms. They must be in Nifti format ".nii.gz".

\noindent \textbf{tracto\_prefix}: The beginning of the tractogram name. The tractogram obtained from FSL have the following name: tracto\_prefix\_x\_y\_z.nii.gz, where 
(x,y,z) is the coordinate of the tractogram.

\noindent \textbf{Regions}: is the list of the requisted number of regions. Remember that this algorithm does not give the exact number of regions as required but it uses
this list to stop growing big regions. 

\subsection{Import it in your code}
You need to use it as follow:\\
import Region\_preparation as RP \\
from Cortical\_surface\_parcellation import Parcellation as CSP
